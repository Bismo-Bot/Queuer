# Queuer
Queuer is plugin that helps other plugins play audio to Discord voice channels (BismoVoiceChannel).

Queuer creates a `Queue` of songs, and these songs can be created by any number of plugins. The queue then plays each song one at a time in a particular order (either by time added, user defined, or randomized if shuffle is enabled).\
Think of this like the queue in Spotify. Allows multiple plugins to play audio without having to worry about other plugins, or controlling playback, etc.
